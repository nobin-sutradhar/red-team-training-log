# SESSION LOG

## 🔥 Session 1 — Deep Work

**Time:** 8:46 AM – 9:36 AM (50m)
**Objective:** Understand networking (Revise OSI Layer 1 & 2 → Begin Layer 3)

### Micro Audit

* **What was done:** Revised Physical Layer (Layer 1) and Data Link Layer (Layer 2) concepts.
* **Artifact Produced:** Execution log repository created with README.md (no networking artifact).
* **Next Action:** Move to Layer 3 (Network Layer).
* **Focus Integrity:** 10/10
* **Compliance to Objective:** 6/10 (Execution log repo created; Layer 3 not started)

### Structural Gap

No tangible networking artifact (notes, diagram, lab, script) produced.

## 🧘 Break — Recovery

**Time:** 9:36 AM – 9:46 AM (10m)
**Protocol:** Movement / Reset

---

# Nightly Meta‑Audit

## Planned Deep Work

* No structured plan defined.

## Actual Deep Work

* 50 minutes completed.

## Artifact Delta (What exists today that did not exist yesterday)

* Execution log GitHub repository with README.md.
* No technical networking artifact.

---

# Cognitive Layer

## Patterns Observed

* Execution without planning.
* Post-walk phone usage breaks discipline chain.

## Blind Spots

* Mistaking revision for progress.
* No enforced artifact rule.

---

# Emotional Sabotage Scan

## Resistance

* Self-doubt (comparison to others).

## Reality Check

Comparison without artifact production is mental noise.

---

# Constraints for Tomorrow

* Walking route limit enforced.
* Minimum 2 hours execution before 10 AM.
* No phone between sessions.

---

# System Improvements Required

* Add mandatory "Artifact Produced" field per session.
* Pre-define deliverable before session starts.

---

# Carryover Task

* Begin OSI Layer 3 with tangible artifact (diagram, structured notes, or lab setup).

---

# Verdict

Streak intact.
Execution minimal.
Artifact density critically low.
System enforcement required immediately.
