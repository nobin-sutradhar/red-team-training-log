# SESSION LOG

## 🔥 Session 1 — Deep Work

**Time:** 7:48 PM – 8:38 PM (50m)
**Objective:** Weaponize Networking — OSI Layer 3

### Micro Audit

* **What was done:** Nothing tangible produced.
* **Bottleneck:** Friends talking in room.
* **Root Cause:** Weak environmental control.
* **Fix:** Ignore noise or change location; enforce isolation protocol.
* **Focus Integrity:** 0/10
* **Compliance to Objective:** 0/10

### Structural Verdict

Time block completed. Output = zero. Session classified as failure in terms of artifact production.

## 🧘 Break — Recovery

**Time:** 8:38 PM – 8:48 PM (10m)

---

## 🔥 Session 2 — Deep Work

**Time:** 9:19 PM – 10:09 PM (50m)
**Objective:** OSI Layer 3 — Networking

### Micro Audit

* **What was done:** Reviewed IP addressing concept (no artifact created).
* **Artifact Produced:** None.
* **Structural Gap:** Concept exposure without externalized output.

## 🧘 Break — Recovery

**Time:** 10:09 PM – 10:19 PM (10m)

# Daily Structural Analysis

## Deep Work Blocks Attempted: 2

* Artifact-producing sessions: 0
* Nominal sessions (time-only): 2

## Dominant Failure Pattern

* Environmental leakage (friends in room).
* Conceptual consumption mistaken for execution.
* No predefined deliverable before session start.

## Immediate Corrections Required

1. Define artifact before pressing start.
2. Change physical environment when interference appears.
3. No “review-only” sessions allowed — must produce diagram, markdown, or lab output.

---

# Carryover Mandate

Create one tangible Layer 3 artifact:

* Structured markdown explaining IP addressing + routing
  OR
* Hand-drawn/ASCII diagram committed
  OR
* Small routing table simulation lab

---

# Verdict

Streak psychologically damaged.
Execution hours logged.
Artifact count: zero.
System discipline unstable.
Environment control insufficient.

Correction window: immediate.
