# SESSION LOG

## 🔥 Session 1 — Deep Work

**Time:** 7:51 PM – 8:47 PM (56m 20s)
**Objective:** Finish Network Layer → Begin Transport Layer

### Micro Audit

* **What was done:** Reviewed and clarified role of Network Layer (Layer 3).
* **Artifact Produced:** None recorded.
* **Bottleneck:** Friend interruption.
* **Root Cause:** No execution gate protecting session boundary.
* **Fix Required:** Pre-session communication lockdown (Do Not Disturb + expectation setting).
* **Next Action:** Produce Layer 3 artifact before moving to Layer 4.
* **Focus Integrity:** 10/10
* **Compliance to Objective:** 10/10 (Declared), but no tangible artifact.

### Structural Gap

Session classified as incomplete due to zero inspectable output.

## 🧘 Break — Recovery

**Time:** 8:48 PM – 8:58 PM (10m)

---

# Nightly Meta-Audit

## Planned Deep Work

* 100 minutes

## Actual Deep Work

* 56 minutes

## Artifact Delta (What exists today that did not exist yesterday)

* None.

---

# Cognitive Layer

## Patterns Observed

* Declaring conceptual understanding as completion.
* No execution gate enforcement.

## Blind Spots

* “Unavoidable” interruption accepted without structural countermeasure.

---

# Emotional Sabotage Scan

## Resistance

* External interruption used as justification for reduced execution volume.

## Reality Check

No artifact = no progress, regardless of perceived clarity.

---

# System Improvements Required

* Mandatory artifact field before session is marked successful.
* Phone on DND before session begins.
* Predefine deliverable in measurable form (file, diagram, lab).

---

# Carryover Task

* Create tangible Layer 3 artifact (diagram + routing explanation + example packet flow).

---

# Verdict

Streak unstable.
Execution gate missing.
Artifact density zero.
System enforcement must tighten immediately.

**Night Audit Score:** 5/10
